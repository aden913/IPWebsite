      content: `
 A mountain of serene calm  
Not a worry to ponder, nor a qualm  
Unnoticed joys and wonders  
Thoughts hardly worth time to ponder  
A calm and comfortable path along the side of cliffs  
Unexpected winds pull and lift  

A valley of overwhelming despair  
Senses overwhelmed by wind and air  
A deep darkness crowding the mind  
Fears anew and then more to find  
A new world to see on the left and right  
Tortured from the memory of the previous night  

Out of the valley into the comfort of sunny mounts  
Soft breeze, warm grass, and fleeting feelings of doubts  
Gratitude swimming in mind  
Soaking in all that is there to find  
Overwhelming feelings of joy, following memories of a valley  
Appreciations left and right, too much to tally.

  Rolling out from the warm bed
Rushing to brush my teeth while half dead
Eating and waiting for class to start
Praying that class will enrich my heart

Residing in a butt-breaking chair
Listening to lecture, attempting to care
Catching a few words here and there
Most I can do is sit and stare

Mind full and tired
Craving caffeine to stay wired
Looking forward to the next meeting
Hoping my brain doesn't take another beating

 Conversations, arguements, debates, gossip and other ways to commune
Only way to survive in these harsh environments is to believe in the triune
Accompanied by aspirations to succeed, to connect, and to relate
These simple or even convaluted actions serve to do nothing more than to create:

Anxiety, what do they think, how did i do, was that right to say?
Stress, do they remember what I said, do i have to say something, will I survive this day?
Despair, why am I solely the initiator, do they notice me, will I be ignored yet another time?
Anger, how could they say something like that, who even are they, they make me want to commit a crime...
Jealousy, how do they perform so well, why does everyone like them, why do people not like me?
Social interactions are not all thorns and weeds, yet some create a beautiful tree:

Happy, I really enjoyed that conversation, that makes me feel better, that just absolutely makes my day!
Excitement, I cannot wait to see everyone, I wonder what we will talk about today, ooh I have something to say!
Joy, I am really glad we got to talk, I am so glad I could help, let me know if you ever need to talk.
Content, I feel as though I belong here, everyone knows me, I can finally enjoy my walk.
Love, I have never felt this way before, thank you so much for this, I will never forget you.
Being social is of utmost importance, rivaling the need for even food or air, it makes the love and grace of christ true.

 Through trials and through errors I have come to know more and more of what my heart seeks
Yet, to this day I do not know what my heart seeks, the idea so far is rather bleak.
I have found that the position that my heart sits, determines the treasure it desires.
Althouth the treasures found in the past were ultimately were thrown into the fires.

Grown up in solitude, not a social interaction in sight
No parental intimacy, just a few through-the-wall fights
War between mind and boredom, fought through the tormenting of my sisters
Family lacking in the department of affection, turned to mere roles of gifters

Blending into the shadows of the systems of school
Stalking all others who were tagged with being 'cool'
Drowning in books containing action, fantasy, and mystery
Staying far apart from my peers, thus is my history

Filled with desires to seek others
My heart searched for a church, hoping to not be a bother.
Finally finding community that accepted me
With people around that finally cared, my heart could focus on who to be.
A journey to become confident in who I am
Years go by, relationships start and relationships ended, all that stuck is the love for the lamb
Through tears and heartache I learn to love, to love God
My families intimacy held far apart, as if held at by a rather long rod

I've been through my ups and downs, sides to sides
Yet my heart has yet to decide
My hearts' journey has led to one conclusion thus far
My heart simply desires to be closer to another
To write a poem opening with the family that is closer than any other

A women not just with a longing for the Lamb
but, of intoxicating joy.
She doesn't need to know how to cook or even make a ham
Just someone who can inspire the one that resides deep in my soul, the boy
who had none close to him.
Let her choice to respond in affection not be a whim
But allow our hearts to serve the Lord our God, till our hearts beat their last beat.

With miles upon miles of ups and downs

Anything we could do would be out of our powers
Our goal to get simply to the top then back down

We all prepared to start our long journey
We made light of the situation with jokes that were corny
In our torture we joked and played games, debating who had won

I want to raise a family
That is interested in more than living happily

I want to lead a family that glorifies God every day.
I want to lead a family where I listen to what everyone has to say.
I want to lead a family where I am comfortable with all of my emotions.
I want to lead a family that seeks God even on vacation at the ocean.
I want to lead a family that has no doubt I love and care for everyone

Under our skin, behind our despair, deeper and deeper underneath
Hidden all around us, yet all the more obvious and clear
If only they would listen and look right over here

Each person's beauty comes in all different shapes and sizes
But it is only when we steward it, is when it rises
Yet we get stuck in our mental spirals, in need of a shove
While trying not to fall deeper, we forget to Love

But there is still something quite beautiful about the treasure not found
Rather than one that is so obvious it is immediately crowned
So I will begin my journey even when you are quite moody
To look for, to praise, to validate, your God given inner beauty

 Creating works of art can make me rather tired
But the best of my art comes out when i'm absolutely wired!
Sometimes I want to work myself like a mule
Yet, I cannot make art without my fuel.

One of the most important of fuels is sleep
So I will surely be counting my sheep.
Food is of course another thing I need
So at every meal I shall feed!
Something else just as important is another person
Otherwise my art will surely worsen.
Some people certainly make me happy and sad
Even at times possibly quite glad or mad.

Some of these emotions might not seem good
Nonetheless they are involved in my art, as they should.

The kinds of things that make people drown in several beers.
Or the simple thought of receiving a hug can make me swell up
With none of them coming may way, its hard to not feel like a cracked cup.
Affections being modeled is another powerful one.
Watching a spouse admit their commitments, not allowing their love to be undone.
How about even the overwhelming desire to be able love a single person
Always seems to make my tear ducts worsen.
Not to forget the one that makes me want to cry and moan
Is the unshakeable feeling that I might just end up alone.

A small village on the outskirts of Evolland.

Our hero preparing to set off for adventure
With everything in order, he begins the venture.
He cannot contain that he is excited
to fulfill his dreams to be united.

With a skip and a hop he is on his way
He marches along rocky paths without delay.
Seeing others on travels of their own
Making our hero feel quite alone.

Enjoying eachother in their pair,

They were performing all sorts of taboo.
This started to fill our hero with doubt
Not sure what his adventures were all about.

He sits down to rest
Under a quiet bird's nest.
Growing drowsey from a lovebird's song
Assuring their mate they surely belong

Filled with a renewed sense of what's right
He sets off again at first sunlight.
Into the deep dark woods
Leaving behind adventures' falsehoods.

Approaching a break in the trees
Clambering through all the debris.
A serene place, was this hidden glade.
But not alone, for something waits in shade.

Our hero finds himself quite enraptured.
With wings of leather
They float, light as a feather.

Our hero struggled to stand upright
At this beautifully dangerous sight.
The creature beckons him to come

Closer and closer our hero crawls
unable to withstand the creatures call.
Once in the creatures embrace
Our hero sees her face.

The creature stares with ambivalous intent
Close enough to devour our hero's scent.
His sight fades to black
As she begins her attack

Our hero lies alone on the ground
Still numb to touch and sound.
Feeling as though something missing
From the devil's deceptive kissing.

Burdened by memories of hurt.

A journey with nothing much
Everything dry to the touch.
No beauty in sight
For our lonely knight.

Stumbling into a new land
Barely able to stand.
The land is full of beautiful sights
Of vibrant greens and whites.

The journey coming to its end
Just around the bend.
Our hero holds himself together
Releasing sword and tattered leather.

A building at the end of the road
From which the life of the land flowed.
Limping up to the door
Embracing for what's more.

He opens the door with a shove
In desperate need of Love.
Into a wide open room
That burns away his gloom.

Greeted by a woman of gold
Who loves quite bold.

And tells him "You've found your place".

After listening to songs of the lyre.
Dreams of unease
Spread as some sort of disease.

Ignoring the sun rising over the lake
And pushes past the door
To grab his soup once more.

Again he waits
With his bowl and plate.
Yet noone pays him attention
Even in fleeting mentions.

Ignoring the feeling that stings.
Off on a quest to a house that's haunted
Where at least he will feel somewhat wanted.

Being given a simple hello,
Continuing the usual tempo.

Yet the moment fades
After these simple charades.
Opportunities are thrown away,
When we simply say hey.

Though a conversation could still ensue
It does depends on who
You end up meeting
And offer up your greeting.

So why take the chance,
But rather take a stance
To not greet someone with hello
And to break up the typical flow.

I won't let complacency rule
For I would feel quite cruel.
And so I offer you this warning,
That you will be greeted by good morning.

In hopes you might pause
And debate the cause
of such a greeting
In our hasty meeting.

My hope is to not simply greet
But to take my time and meet.
Although you may think me boring
I shall still greet you, with good morning.

  Like most things, there is a problem with bored.
Likely due to their heart being cut by sword.
With a loss of what was once so needed
Can make experiencing joy rather impeded.

Though through all of its wounds
They still experience the stars and their moons.
Not losing sight of what is incredible,
Whilst their heart feels quite edible.

Through thick and thin
They've developed quite the thick skin.
Still fun to be around
Even if they feel quite down.

For life wouldn't be the same without it
Everyone would miss their wit,
Their enjoyable conversations.
You cannot deny everyone's admirations.

Although they have been through alot
With many battles being fought.
We just need to see
If she'll ever be free.

And so everyone should sit and talk
To know more about their walk.
As there is so much more to be explored
When talking with deBard.

      content: `
 There is nothing wrong with being short. 
Although it doesn't help on the court
It certainly has it's advantage
 When there is a few things to manage.
You should be quite proud
 With how you disappear in a crowd.
Or that you don't hit your head
 When you toss and turn in bed.
Then there are the other things,
 Like how easy you are to fling,
  Or that you are quite sadder,
Because short stacks are usually madder.
I don't fault you for your shortcomings,
Especially with who you are becoming.
You are fun to be around and you have people's back
That is why we like hanging out with short stack.

      title: "Mannerisms Matter",
      content: `
  There is something so interesting about the mundane
The hidden gems in what is so seemingly plain.
Everyone more than a mere organism
Bearing the gift of their mannerism.

Such a powerful thing it is
That is uniqely hers or his.
A unique way to tell
If they are doing well.

But let me not be too quick,
Most think it interesting as a brick.
Often looked past
Never seeming to last.

Being so inundated
Lots left to be located.
Unless expectations are blown
Will their intentions be known.

Appreciation is due!
To a select few.
Who break the mold
And are quite bold.

I have one in mind
That is a unique find.
Reminiscent of a prism
A rainbow flowing from their mannerism.

Their affinity for the outrageous
Is quite contagious.
The message they convey
Will brighten up your day.

Their body's velocity
Gives a sense of curiosity.
Such a delight to be around
Will surely melt away any frown.

So pay attention for the coming days
As you can talk in many different ways.
One more influencing than chatter
Is the reason mannerisms matter.

    title: "Gary and His Cold Furnace (Psalm 103)",
    content: `
Gary is a special little golem
That struggled with a special little problem
All the other golems had big hot furnaces
That would heat up all nearby surfaces

But the furnace in Gary's chest
Was unlike all the rest
The flame in his chest was weak
Making him feel rather meek

When everyone left to work
Gary would stay back to lurk
His situation quite dire
Because of his small fire

"Your fire is cold"
Is what he was told
He wanted to do better
Something that might matter 

But his furnace was quite chilly
And he felt too guilty
Gary felt rather sad
And wanted what others had

Gary began to stare at his flame
In it's tiny little frame
"Why are you so timid
Everything I do is frigid

My work is not good
It doesn't turn out like it should
I just want to please the creator
But I just feel like a traitor

So, if you can listen please
Hear me and my pleas
Grow to be much stronger
So that I may no longer be somber

I want to do better
Something that will matter
His flame heard his whispers
And Gary's doubts began to wither

Gary's small flame began to bloom
Until there was no more room
So Gary stands up once more
To do what he was made for
