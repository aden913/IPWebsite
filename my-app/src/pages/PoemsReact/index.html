    <div id="A Journey Through The Valley">
        <h2>"A Mountain of Serene Calm"</h2>
        <p><br>
            Not a worry to ponder, nor a qualm<br>
            Unnoticed joys and wonders<br>
            Thoughts hardly worth time to ponder<br>
            A calm and comfortable path along the side of cliffs<br>
            Unexpected winds pull and lift<br>
            <br>
            A valley of overwhelming despair<br>
            Senses overwhelmed by wind and air<br>
            A deep darkness crowding the mind<br>
            Fears anew and then more to find<br>
            A new world to see on the left and right<br>
            Tortured from the memory of the previous night<br>
            <br>
            Out of the valley into the comfort of sunny mounts<br>
            Soft breeze, warm grass, and fleeting feelings of doubts<br>
            Gratitude swimming in mind<br>
            Soaking in all that is there to find<br>
            Overwhelming feelings of joy, following memories of a valley<br>
            Appreciations left and right, too much to tally.<br></p>

        <p>Rolling out from the warm bed<br>
            Rushing to brush my teeth while half dead<br>
            Eating and waiting for class to start<br>
            Praying that class will enrich my heart<br><br>
            
            Residing in a butt-breaking chair<br>
            Listening to lecture, attempting to care<br>
            Catching a few words here and there<br>
            Most I can do is sit and stare<br><br>
            
            Mind full and tired<br>
            Craving caffeine to stay wired<br>
            Looking forward to the next meeting<br>
            Hoping my brain doesn't take another beating<br><br></p>

    <div id="Awareness of social Un-Awareness">
        <h2>"Awareness of social Un-Awareness"</h2>
        <p>Conversations, arguements, debates, gossip and other ways to commune<br>
            Only way to survive in these harsh environments is to believe in the triune<br>
            Accompanied by aspirations to succeed, to connect, and to relate<br>
            These simple or even convaluted actions serve to do nothing more than to create:<br><br>
            
            Anxiety, what do they think, how did i do, was that right to say?<br>
            Stress, do they remember what I said, do i have to say something, will I survive this day?<br>
            Despair, why am I solely the initiator, do they notice me, will I be ignored yet another time?<br>
            Anger, how could they say something like that, who even are they, they make me want to commit a crime...<br>
            Jealousy, how do they perform so well, why does everyone like them, why do people not like me?<br>
            Social interactions are not all thorns and weeds, yet some create a beautiful tree:<br><br>
            
            Happy, I really enjoyed that conversation, that makes me feel better, that just absolutely makes my day!<br>
            Excitement, I cannot wait to see everyone, I wonder what we will talk about today, ooh I have something to say!<br>
            Joy, I am really glad we got to talk, I am so glad I could help, let me know if you ever need to talk.<br>
            Content, I feel as though I belong here, everyone knows me, I can finally enjoy my walk.<br>
            Love, I have never felt this way before, thank you so much for this, I will never forget you.<br>
            Being social is of utmost importance, rivaling the need for even food or air, it makes the love and grace of christ true.<br></p>

    <div id="What dost my heart seek now?">
        <h2>"What dost my heart seek now?"</h2>
        <p>Through trials and through errors I have come to know more and more of what my heart seeks<br>
            Yet, to this day I do not know what my heart seeks, the idea so far is rather bleak.<br>
            I have found that the position in which my heart sits, determines the treasure it desires.<br>
            Althouth the treasures found in the past were ultimately were thrown into the fires.<br><br>
            
            Grown up in solitude, not a social interaction in sight<br>
            No parental intimacy, just a few through-the-wall fights<br>
            War between mind and boredom, relieved through the subtle torment of my sisters<br>
            Family lacking in the department of affection, turned to mere roles of gifters<br><br>
            
            Blending into the shadows of the systems of school<br>
            Stalking all others who were tagged with being 'cool'<br>
            Drowning in books containing action, fantasy, and mystery<br>
            Staying far apart from my peers, thus is my history<br><br>
            
            Filled with desires to seek others<br>
            My heart searched for a church, hoping to not be a bother.<br>
            Finally finding community that accepted me<br>
            With people around that finally cared, my heart could focus on who to be.<br>
            A journey to become confident in who I am<br>
            Years go by, relationships start and relationships ended, all that stuck is the love for the lamb<br>
            Through tears and heartache I learn to love, to love God<br>
            My families intimacy held far apart, as if held at by a rather long rod<br><br>
            
            I've been through my ups and downs, sides to sides<br>
            Yet my heart has yet to decide<br>
            My hearts' journey has led to one conclusion thus far<br>
            My heart simply desires to be closer to another<br>
            To write a poem opening with the family that is closer than any other<br><br>
            
            A women not just with a longing for the Lamb<br>
            but, of intoxicating joy.<br>
            She doesn't need to know how to cook or even make a ham<br>
            Just someone who can inspire the one that resides deep in my soul, the boy<br>
            who had none close to him.<br>
            Let her choice to respond in affection not be a whim<br>
            But allow our hearts to serve the Lord our God, till our hearts beat their last beat.<br></p>

        <p>Who can do anything but be like me!<br>
            There is nothing to think or do than to love the tree!<br>
            I wander the forest, left and right<br>

            My violence will be earned for nothing but free!<br>

            If anyone desires to cut them down they will have to go through me.<br><br>

            There is nothing more evil than to take it to make a shelf!<br>

        <p>Some things have you wonder why they exist<br>
            Even when their evil simply persists<br>
            Cats... why do we keep them around?<br>
            They don't do much to astound<br><br>
            
            At most cats seem to do is bite and scratch<br>
            I admit some will cuddle to think you are quite the catch.<br>
            Most attitudes of such felines is nothing less than malevolent<br>
            Although that seems to change when their owner is benevolent.<br><br>
            
            Though their use is practically null<br>
            There is no need to initiate a cull.<br>

            We would have nothing but the comfort of our frowns<br><br>

            I want to lead a family that glorifies God every day.<br>
            I want to lead a family where I listen to what everyone has to say.<br>
            I want to lead a family where I am comfortable with all of my emotions.<br>
            I want to lead a family that seeks God even on vacation at the ocean.<br>
            I want to lead a family that has no doubt I love and care for everyone<br>
            I want to lead a family that will spread the gospel to anyone<br><br>

            This is my passion for now<br>
            There is not much else I shall allow<br>
            I intend for this to all work out God's way<br>
            So for now, I will seek the Lord every day.<br><br>

            You fantastically transform all those dull words<br>

        <h2>Inner Beauty</h2>
        <p>
            There is something quite beautiful hidden beneath<br>
            Under our skin, behind our despair, deeper and deeper underneath<br>
            Hidden all around us, yet all the more obvious and clear<br>
            If only they would listen and look right over here<br><br>

            Each person's beauty comes in all different shapes and sizes<br>
            But it is only when we steward it, is when it rises<br>
            Yet we get stuck in our mental spirals, in need of a shove<br>
            While trying not to fall deeper, we forget to Love<br><br>

            But there is still something quite beautiful about the treasure not found<br>
            Rather than one that is so obvious it is immediately crowned<br>
            So I will begin my journey even when you are quite moody<br>
            To look for, to praise, to validate, your God given inner beauty<br><br>

        <p>
            Creating works of art can make me rather tired<br>
            But the best of my art comes out when i'm absolutely wired!<br>
            Sometimes I want to work myself like a mule<br>
            Yet, I cannot make art without my fuel.<br><br>

            One of the most important of fuels is sleep<br>
            So I will surely be counting my sheep.<br>
            Food is of course another thing I need<br>
            So at every meal I shall feed!<br>
            Something else just as important is another person<br>
            Otherwise my art will surely worsen.<br>
            Some people certainly make me happy and sad<br>
            Even at times possibly quite glad or mad.<br><br>

            Some of these emotions might not seem good<br>
            Nonetheless they are involved in my art, as they should.<br>
            This allows what I create to be harsh as glass, or soft as wool<br>
            These are the things I consider to be my "artFuel"<br><br>

<br>
            I have been informed on a mystical thing...<br>
            Incredibly valuable, even more than the shiniest of ring!<br>
            It is supposedly a need, though I do want it.<br>
            This logic is putting me in quite a fit...<br>
            I'll just sit back and relax, equipped with a mug<br>

            But sometimes it is too hard not to do something bad...<br>
            I think deep wounds of mine have caused some tears<br>
            The kinds of things that make people drown in several beers.<br>
            Or the simple thought of receiving a hug can make me swell up<br>
            With none of them coming may way, its hard to not feel like a cracked cup.<br>
            Affections being modeled is another powerful one.<br>
            Watching a spouse admit their commitments, not allowing their love to be undone.<br>
            How about even the overwhelming desire to be able love a single person<br>
            Always seems to make my tear ducts worsen.<br>
            Not to forget the one that makes me want to cry and moan<br>
            Is the unshakeable feeling that I might just end up alone.<br>
            It's hard to pinpoint the why<br>
            There just seems to be so many things that want to make me cry.<br>

            Our story begins in a quiet part of our wonderland<br>
            A small village on the outskirts of Evolland.<br>
<br>
            Our hero preparing to set off on his adventure<br>
            With everything in order he sets off on his venture.<br>
            He cannot contain that he is excited<br>
            to one day be united.<br>
<br>
            With a skip and a hop he is on the way<br>
            He continues along a dirt path without delay.<br>
            Passing by others on adventures of their own<br>
            Making our hero feel quite alone.<br>
<br>
            Others were enjoying their time mostly in pairs<br>
            Filled with an overwhelming feeling that this is unfair.<br>
            Our hero can't help but to despair<br>
            Yet they continue on to elsewhere.<br>
<br>
            The images stuck in his mind<br>
            Of his fellow members of mankind<br>
            Swooning over eachother,<br>
            That reminded him of his father and mother.<br>
<br>
            Yet of the other adventurers he saw something new<br>
            They were performing all sorts of taboo.<br>
            This started to fill our hero with doubt<br>
            Not sure what his adventure was all about.<br>
<br>
            He sits down to rest<br>
            Under a tree with a quiet bird's nest.<br>
            Falling asleep to the sweet sound of a lovebird's song<br>
            Assuring their feathery mate they surely belong<br>
<br>
            Filled with a renewed sense of what's right<br>
            They set off again at first sunlight.<br>
            Into the deep dark woods<br>
            Leaving behind this sense of falsehood.<br>
<br>
            Approaching a break in the trees<br>
            Into an open space littered with debris.<br>
            A serene place, was this hidden glade.<br>
            But not alone, for something waits in the shade.<br>
<br>
            A creature of tall stature<br>
            Our hero finds his heart quite enraptured.<br>
            With wings of leather<br>
            They float above the ground light as a feather.<br>
<br>
            Our hero struggled to stand upright<br>
            At this beautifully dangerous sight.<br>
            The creature extends its finger invites him to come<br>
            Our hero succumbs, feeling completely numb.<br>
<br>
            Closer and closer our hero crawls<br>
            unable to withstand the creatures call.<br>
            Until in the creatures embrace<br>
            Our hero sees their face.<br>
<br>
            The creature sneers with malicious intent<br>
            Ready to devour our hero's scent.<br>
            All goes black<br>
            After the attack<br>
<br>
            Our hero lies on the ground<br>
            Still numb to touch and sound.<br>
            Feeling as though something missing<br>
            From the devil's kissing.<br>
<br>
            Our Hero slowly returns to standing<br>
            As though under a new branding.<br>
            Our hero walks on<br>
            Into the solemnly sweet dawn<br>

            A journey with nothing much<br>
            Sand, cracked dirt, everything that is dry to the touch.<br>
            No beauty in sight<br>
            For our lonely knight.<br>
<br>
            Our hero makes his way into a new land<br>
            With a numbing sensation threatening his ability to stand.<br>
            The land is full of beautiful sights<br>
            Lush fields of green, kids playing under the sun, and kites in flight.<br>
<br>
            The journey coming to its end<br>
            With the treasure being just around the bend.<br>
            Our hero holds himself together<br>
            Throwing off his sword and tattered leather.<br>
<br>
            A building at the end of the road<br>
            From which the life of the land flowed.<br>
            Limping up to the door<br>
            Brushing against the warm feel of the floor.<br>
<br>
            He opens the door with a shove<br>
            In desperate need of Love.<br>
            Into the wide an open room<br>
            That attempts to burn away his gloom.<br>
<br>
            Greeted by a woman of gold<br>
            Who loves quite bold.<br>
            She captures our hero in embrace<br>
            And tells him "You've found your place".<br>
<br>
            The end of our hero's story<br>
            Being wrapped up in glory.<br>
            Soothing his pain more than any drug<br>
            Was his journey to find his long lost hug.<br>

        <p>
            I am stuck in this desert of mine.<br>
            In constant search for a sign<br>
            That I am nearing the end<br>
            And so I can get on the mend.<br>
<br>
            Surrounded by sand and dune<br>
            Under the scorching sun and freezing moon.<br>
            I search on and on<br>
            Until the break of dawn.<br>
<br>
            With nothing in sight<br>
            Than the sun's blinding light.<br>
            I slowly grow weary<br>
            As the lack of 'things' is quite eerie.<br>
<br>
            I am ready to give in<br>
            As the heat scorches my skin.<br>
            The sound of my name gives me the shocks<br>
            When I am told to leave, my sandbox.<br>

        <h2>Let's Murder</h2>
        <p>
            Murder is often used wrong.<br>
            But it has a different song<br>
            It's really worth listening to<br>
            It might give you a different view.<br>
<br>
            My goal is to murder me.<br>
            So that I may finally be free.<br>
            But I don't mean suicide<br>
            But more like my death of pride.<br>
<br>
            I intend to break the mold<br>
            And throw off the old<br>
            To put on the new<br>
            A sort of internal coup.<br>
<br>
            So I'll crush him with a slab,<br>
            Give him a stab,<br>
            Right in the liver,<br>
            And throw him into the river.<br>
<br>
            So murder isn't all that bad.<br>
            There is no reason to be sad.<br>
            I hope I've changed your view<br>
            Before my next person is you.<br>

        <h2>The Tavern</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to the tavern!<br>
            From forest to cavern<br>
            You can find all your quests<br>
            Or you can take your time, to sit and rest.<br>
<br>
            Where everyone from all over come<br>
            To hear the pluck of the guitar and beat of the drum.<br>
            Our crowds are diverse<br>
            So share some ale, and empty your purse.<br>
<br>
            This was The taverns advertisement.<br>
            And let in on no advisement<br>
            Our hero steps in to the abode<br>
            To eventually leave with stories never foretold.<br>
<br>
            After his long quest<br>
            Our hero seeks to rest.<br>
            So he tosses a coin<br>
            And a bed he is to join.<br>
<br>
            A restful night<br>
            With dreams of yesterdays plight.<br>
            Awaking in the small room<br>
            Into the dawns warm gloom.<br>
<br>
            Our hero ventures back into the party<br>
            To a crowd that is nothing but hearty.<br>
            Mages, rogues, knights, and more<br>
            Is all who come into the door.<br>
<br>
            Our hero sits among them<br>
            To share stories of mayhem<br>
            And to share in song<br>
            As the night goes long.<br>
            <br>
            Our hero retires back to their small room<br>
            As exhaustion begins to loom.<br>
            Laying onto his beaten up bed<br>
            He rests his head.<br>
<br>
            Dreaming of the fun that was had<br>
            Making him feel quite glad<br>
            That this was his choice<br>
            To find others to share and rejoice.<br>
<br>
            New mornings arise<br>
            Our hero begins to rise<br>
            To seek out another group<br>
            And enjoy a nice bowl of soup.<br>
<br>
            With soup in hand<br>
            Our hero sits and stands<br>
            For some sort of invitation<br>
            Yet all that's recieved is hesitation.<br>
<br>
            He asks to join a group<br>
            And they all give a mighty whoop!<br>
            As they accept him<br>
            On what felt as a some sort of whim.<br>
<br>
            Our hero retires<br>
            After listening to songs of the lyre.<br>
            Dreams of unease<br>
            Spread as some sort of disease.<br>
<br>
            Our hero awakes<br>
            Ignoring the sun rising over the lake<br>
            And pushes past the door<br>
            To grab his soup once more.<br>
<br>
            Again he waits<br>
            With his bowl and plate.<br>
            Yet noone pays him attention<br>
            Even in fleeting mentions.<br>
<br>
            So our hero gathers his things<br>
            Ignoring the feeling that stings.<br>
            Off on a quest to a house that's haunted<br>
            Where at least he will feel somewhat wanted.<br>

        <h2>Good Morning</h2>
        <p>
            Have you ever been greeted<br>
            And wondered how you were treated?<br>
            Being given a simple hello,<br>
            Continuing the usual tempo.<br>
<br>
            Yet the moment fades<br>
            After these simple charades.<br>
            Opportunities are thrown away,<br>
            When we simply say hey.<br>
<br>
            Though a conversation could still ensue<br>
            It does depends on who<br>
            You end up meeting<br>
            And offer up your greeting.<br>
<br>
            So why take the chance,<br>
            But rather take a stance<br>
            To not greet someone with hello<br>
            And to break up the typical flow.<br>
<br>
            I won't let complacency rule<br>
            For I would feel quite cruel.<br>
            And so I offer you this warning,<br>
            That you will be greeted by good morning.<br>
<br>
            In hopes you might pause<br>
            And debate the cause<br>
            of such a greeting<br>
            In our hasty meeting.<br>
<br>
            My hope is to not simply greet<br>
            But to take my time and meet.<br>
            Although you may think me boring<br>
            I shall still greet you, with good morning.<br>

        <p>
            Like most things, there is a problem with bored.<br>
            Likely due to their heart being cut by sword.<br>
            With a loss of what was once so needed<br>
            Can make experiencing joy rather impeded.<br>
<br>
            Though through all of its wounds<br>
            They still experience the stars and their moons.<br>
            Not losing sight of what is incredible,<br>
            Whilst their heart feels quite edible.<br>
            <br>
            Through thick and thin<br>
            They've developed quite the thick skin.<br>
            Still fun to be around<br>
            Even if they feel quite down.<br>
<br>
            For life wouldn't be the same without it<br>
            Everyone would miss their wit,<br>
            Their enjoyable conversations.<br>
            You cannot deny everyone's admirations.<br>

            Although they have been through alot<br>
            With many battles being fought.<br>
            We just need to see<br>
            If she'll ever be free.<br>
<br>
            And so everyone should sit and talk<br>
            To know more about their walk.<br>
            As there is so much more to be explored<br>

        <h2>Short Stack</h2>
        <p>
            There is nothing wrong with being short.
            Although it doesn't help on the court
            It certainly has it's advantage
            When there is a few things to manage.

            You should be quite proud
            With how you disappear in a crowd.
            Or that you don't hit your head
            When you toss and turn in bed.

            Then there are the other things,
            Like how easy you are to fling,
            Or that you are quite sadder,
            Because short stacks are usually madder.

            I don't fault you for your shortcomings,
            Especially with who you are becoming.
            You are fun to be around and you have people's back
            That is why we like hanging out with short stack.

        <h2>Mannerisms Matter</h2>
        <p>
            There is something so interesting about the mundane<br>
            The hidden gems in what is so seemingly plain.<br>
            Everyone more than a mere organism<br>
            Bearing the gift of their mannerism.<br>
<br>
            Such a powerful thing it is<br>
            That is uniqely hers or his.<br>
            A unique way to tell<br>
            If they are doing well.<br>
<br>
            But let me not be too quick,<br>
            Most think it interesting as a brick.<br>
            Often looked past<br>
            Never seeming to last.<br>
<br>
            Being so inundated<br>
            Lots left to be located.<br>
            Unless expectations are blown<br>
            Will their intentions be known.<br>
<br>
            Appreciation is due!<br>
            To a select few.<br>
            Who break the mold<br>
            And are quite bold.<br>
<br>
            I have one in mind<br>
            That is a unique find.<br>
            Reminiscent of a prism<br>
            A rainbow flowing from their mannerism.<br>
<br>
            Their affinity for the outrageous<br>
            Is quite contagious.<br>
            The message they convey<br>
            Will brighten up your day.<br>
<br>
            Their body's velocity<br>
            Gives a sense of curiosity.<br>
            Such a delight to be around<br>
            Will surely melt away any frown.<br>
<br>
            So pay attention for the coming days<br>
            As you can talk in many different ways.<br>
            One more influencing than chatter<br>
            Is the reason mannerisms matter.<br>
