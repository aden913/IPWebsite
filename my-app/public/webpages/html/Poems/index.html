    <div id="A Journey Through The Valley">
        <h2>"A Mountain of Serene Calm"</h2>
        <p><br>
            Not a worry to ponder, nor a qualm<br>
            Unnoticed joys and wonders<br>
            Thoughts hardly worth time to ponder<br>
            A calm and comfortable path along the side of cliffs<br>
            Unexpected winds pull and lift<br>
            <br>
            A valley of overwhelming despair<br>
            Senses overwhelmed by wind and air<br>
            A deep darkness crowding the mind<br>
            Fears anew and then more to find<br>
            A new world to see on the left and right<br>
            Tortured from the memory of the previous night<br>
            <br>
            Out of the valley into the comfort of sunny mounts<br>
            Soft breeze, warm grass, and fleeting feelings of doubts<br>
            Gratitude swimming in mind<br>
            Soaking in all that is there to find<br>
            Overwhelming feelings of joy, following memories of a valley<br>
            Appreciations left and right, too much to tally.<br></p>

        <p>Rolling out from the warm bed<br>
            Rushing to brush my teeth while half dead<br>
            Eating and waiting for class to start<br>
            Praying that class will enrich my heart<br><br>
            
            Residing in a butt-breaking chair<br>
            Listening to lecture, attempting to care<br>
            Catching a few words here and there<br>
            Most I can do is sit and stare<br><br>
            
            Mind full and tired<br>
            Craving caffeine to stay wired<br>
            Looking forward to the next meeting<br>
            Hoping my brain doesn't take another beating<br><br></p>

        <h2>"Awareness of social Un-Awareness"</h2>
        <p>Conversations, arguements, debates, gossip and other ways to commune<br>
            Only way to survive in these harsh environments is to believe in the triune<br>
            Accompanied by aspirations to succeed, to connect, and to relate<br>
            These simple or even convaluted actions serve to do nothing more than to create:<br><br>
            
            Anxiety, what do they think, how did i do, was that right to say?<br>
            Stress, do they remember what I said, do i have to say something, will I survive this day?<br>
            Despair, why am I solely the initiator, do they notice me, will I be ignored yet another time?<br>
            Anger, how could they say something like that, who even are they, they make me want to commit a crime...<br>
            Jealousy, how do they perform so well, why does everyone like them, why do people not like me?<br>
            Social interactions are not all thorns and weeds, yet some create a beautiful tree:<br><br>
            
            Happy, I really enjoyed that conversation, that makes me feel better, that just absolutely makes my day!<br>
            Excitement, I cannot wait to see everyone, I wonder what we will talk about today, ooh I have something to say!<br>
            Joy, I am really glad we got to talk, I am so glad I could help, let me know if you ever need to talk.<br>
            Content, I feel as though I belong here, everyone knows me, I can finally enjoy my walk.<br>
            Love, I have never felt this way before, thank you so much for this, I will never forget you.<br>
            Being social is of utmost importance, rivaling the need for even food or air, it makes the love and grace of christ true.<br></p>

    <div id="What dost my heart seek now?">
        <h2>"What dost my heart seek now?"</h2>
        <p>Through trials and through errors I have come to know more and more of what my heart seeks<br>
            Yet, to this day I do not know what my heart seeks, the idea so far is rather bleak.<br>
            I have found that the position that my heart sits, determines the treasure it desires.<br>
            Althouth the treasures found in the past were ultimately were thrown into the fires.<br><br>
            
            Grown up in solitude, not a social interaction in sight<br>
            No parental intimacy, just a few through-the-wall fights<br>
            War between mind and boredom, fought through the tormenting of my sisters<br>
            Family lacking in the department of affection, turned to mere roles of gifters<br><br>
            
            Blending into the shadows of the systems of school<br>
            Stalking all others who were tagged with being 'cool'<br>
            Drowning in books containing action, fantasy, and mystery<br>
            Staying far apart from my peers, thus is my history<br><br>
            
            Filled with desires to seek others<br>
            My heart searched for a church, hoping to not be a bother.<br>
            Finally finding community that accepted me<br>
            With people around that finally cared, my heart could focus on who to be.<br>
            A journey to become confident in who I am<br>
            Years go by, relationships start and relationships ended, all that stuck is the love for the lamb<br>
            Through tears and heartache I learn to love, to love God<br>
            My families intimacy held far apart, as if held at by a rather long rod<br><br>
            
            I've been through my ups and downs, sides to sides<br>
            Yet my heart has yet to decide<br>
            My hearts' journey has led to one conclusion thus far<br>
            My heart simply desires to be closer to another<br>
            To write a poem opening with the family that is closer than any other<br><br>
            
            A women not just with a longing for the Lamb<br>
            but, of intoxicating joy.<br>
            She doesn't need to know how to cook or even make a ham<br>
            Just someone who can inspire the one that resides deep in my soul, the boy<br>
            who had none close to him.<br>
            Let her choice to respond in affection not be a whim<br>
            But allow our hearts to serve the Lord our God, till our hearts beat their last beat.<br></p>

        <p>Who can do anything but be like me!<br>
            There is nothing to think or do than to love the tree!<br>
            I wander the forest, left and right<br>
            trying to find someone to pick a fight!<br><br>
            
            For if you touch my tree<br>
            My violence will be earned for nothing but free!<br>
            There is nothing I love more than my trees!<br>
            If anyone desires to cut them down they will have to go through me.<br><br>
            
            There is nothing more beautiful than the tree itself<br>
            There is nothing more evil than to take it to make a shelf!<br>

        <p>Some things have you wonder why they exist<br>
            Even when their evil simply persists<br>
            Cats... why do we keep them around?<br>
            They don't do much to astound<br><br>
            
            At most cats seem to do is bite and scratch<br>
            I admit some will cuddle to think you are quite the catch.<br>
            Most attitudes of such felines is nothing less than malevolent<br>
            Although that seems to change when their owner is benevolent.<br><br>
            
            Though their use is practically null<br>
            There is no need to initiate a cull.<br>
            If they can make my friend happy<br>
            Then, I guess they must not be all that crappy...<br></p>

            With miles upon miles of ups and downs<br>
            We would have nothing but the comfort of our frowns<br><br>

            We are dreading to go after we leave town.<br><br>
            
            We all prepared to start our long journey<br>
            We made light of the situation with jokes that were corny<br>

            Yelling something about rats and rooms as if performing a stunt.<br><br>
            
            It lasted forever yet im informed it was mere seconds<br>

        <p>
            Many humans contain passions<br>
            They wear it almost as if its their fashion<br>
            Some are strong as steel, and others still in the making<br>
            If I said I had no passion I'd be faking<br><br>

            My passion rises from my past<br>
            However it didn't come to me fast<br>
            My ultimate goal is to glorify God, the father<br>
            Afterall it's only through him shall I go any farther<br>
            I want to raise a family<br>
            That is interested more than living happily<br><br>

            I want to lead a family that glorifies God every day.<br>
            I want to lead a family where I listen to what everyone has to say.<br>
            I want to lead a family where I am comfortable with all of my emotions.<br>
            I want to lead a family that seeks God even on vacation at the ocean.<br>
            I want to lead a family that has no doubt I love and care for everyone<br>
            I want to lead a family that will spread the gospel to anyone<br><br>

            This is my passion for now<br>
            There is not much else I will allow<br>
            I intend for this to all work out God's way<br>
            So for now, I will seek the Lord every day.<br><br>

            You fantastically transform all those dull words<br>

        <h2>Inner Beauty</h2>
        <p>
            There is something quite beautiful hidden beneath<br>
            Under our skin, behind our despair, deeper and deeper underneath<br>
            Hidden all around us, yet all the more obvious and clear<br>
            If only they would listen and look right over here<br><br>

            Each person's beauty comes in all different shapes and sizes<br>
            But it is only when we steward it, is when it rises<br>
            Yet we get stuck in our mental spirals, in need of a shove<br>
            While trying not to fall deeper, we forget to Love<br><br>

            But there is still something quite beautiful about the treasure not found<br>
            Rather than one that is so obvious it is immediately crowned<br>
            So I will begin my journey even when you are quite moody<br>
            To look for, to praise, to validate, your God given inner beauty<br><br>

        <h2>Artfuel</h2>
        <p>
            Creating works of art can make me rather tired<br>
            But the best of my art comes out when i'm absolutely wired!<br>
            Sometimes I want to work myself like a mule<br>
            Yet, I cannot make art without my fuel.<br><br>

            One of the most important of fuels is sleep<br>
            So I will surely be counting my sheep.<br>
            Food is of course another thing I need<br>
            So at every meal I shall feed!<br>
            Something else just as important is another person<br>
            Otherwise my art will surely worsen.<br>
            Some people certainly make me happy and sad<br>
            Even at times possibly quite glad or mad.<br><br>

            Some of these emotions might not seem good<br>
            Nonetheless they are involved in my art, as they should.<br>
            This allows what I create to be harsh as glass, or soft as wool<br>
            These are the things I consider to be my "artFuel"<br><br>

            Do I want because I need? Or Need because I want? What do I do!<br>
<br>
            I have been informed on a mystical thing...<br>
            Incredibly valuable, even more than the shiniest of ring!<br>
            It is supposedly a need, though I do want it.<br>
            This logic is putting me in quite a fit...<br>
            I'll just sit back and relax, equipped with a mug<br>
            Busy contemplating the elusive hug.<br>
<br>
            To want it or to need it<br>
            This is as clear as a room that is dimly lit.<br>
            These thoughts continue to grow like a weed<br>

            Sometimes I have a stye<br>

            There's nothing better than feeling like a happy little boy<br>
            Of course there is tears when I am sad.<br>
            But sometimes it is too hard not to do something bad...<br>
            I think deep wounds of mine have caused some tears<br>
            The kinds of things that make people drown in several beers.<br>
            Or the simple thought of receiving a hug can make me swell up<br>
            With none of them coming may way, its hard to not feel like a cracked cup.<br>
            Affections being modeled is another powerful one.<br>
            Watching a spouse admit their commitments, not allowing their love to be undone.<br>
            How about even the overwhelming desire to be able love a single person<br>
            Always seems to make my tear ducts worsen.<br>
            Not to forget the one that makes me want to cry and moan<br>
            Is the unshakeable feeling that I might just end up alone.<br>
            It's hard to pinpoint the why<br>
            There just seems to be so many things that want to make me cry.<br>

            Sounds to be described as nothing less than smooth to the ear<br>
