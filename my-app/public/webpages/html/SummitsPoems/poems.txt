"A Journey Through The Valley"

A mountain of serene calm
Not a worry to ponder, nor a qualm
Unnoticed joys and wonders
Thoughts hardly worth time to ponder
A calm and comfortable path along the side of cliffs
Unexpected winds pull and lift

A valley of overwhelming despair
Senses overwhelmed by wind and air
A deep darkness crowding the mind
Fears anew and then more to find
A new world to see on the left and right
Tortured from the memory of the previous night

Out of the valley into the comfort of sunny mounts
Soft breeze, warm grass, and fleeting feelings of doubts
Gratitude swimming in mind
Soaking in all that is there to find
Overwhelming feelings of joy, following memories of a valley
Appreciations left and right, too much to tally.



"Morning Class"

Rolling out from the warm bed
Rushing to brush my teeth while half dead
Eating and waiting for class to start
Praying that class will enrich my heart

Residing in a butt-breaking chair
Listening to lecture, attempting to care
Catching a few words here and there
Most I can do is sit and stare

Mind full and tired
Craving caffeine to stay wired
Looking forward to the next meeting
Hoping my brain doesn't take another beating



"Awareness of social Un-Awareness"

Conversations, arguements, debates, gossip and other ways to commune
Only way to survive in these harsh environments is to believe in the triune
Accompanied by aspirations to succeed, to connect, and to relate
These simple or even convaluted actions serve to do nothing more than to create:

Anxiety, what do they think, how did i do, was that right to say?
Stress, do they remember what I said, do i have to say something, will I survive this day?
Despair, why am I solely the initiator, do they notice me, will I be ignored yet another time?
Anger, how could they say something like that, who even are they, they make me want to commit a crime...
Jealousy, how do they perform so well, why does everyone like them, why do people not like me?
Social interactions are not all thorns and weeds, yet some create a beautiful tree:

Happy, I really enjoyed that conversation, that makes me feel better, that just absolutely makes my day!
Excitement, I cannot wait to see everyone, I wonder what we will talk about today, ooh I have something to say!
Joy, I am really glad we got to talk, I am so glad I could help, let me know if you ever need to talk.
Content, I feel as though I belong here, everyone knows me, I can finally enjoy my walk.
Love, I have never felt this way before, thank you so much for this, I will never forget you.
Being social is of utmost importance, rivaling the need for even food or air, it makes the love and grace of christ true.




"What dost my heart seek now?"

Through trials and through errors I have come to know more and more of what my heart seeks
Yet, to this day I do not know what my heart seeks, the idea so far is rather bleak.
I have found that the position that my heart sits, determines the treasure it desires.
Althouth the treasures found in the past were ultimately were thrown into the fires.

Grown up in solitude, not a social interaction in sight
No parental intimacy, just a few through-the-wall fights
War between mind and boredom, fought through the tormenting of my sisters
Family lacking in the department of affection, turned to mere roles of gifters

Blending into the shadows of the systems of school
Stalking all others who were tagged with being 'cool'
Drowning in books containing action, fantasy, and mystery
Staying far apart from my peers, thus is my history

Filled with desires to seek others
My heart searched for a church, hoping to not be a bother.
Finally finding community that accepted me
With people around that finally cared, my heart could focus on who to be.
A journey to become confident in who I am
Years go by, relationships start and relationships ended, all that stuck is the love for the lamb
Through tears and heartache I learn to love, to love God
My families intimacy held far apart, as if held at by a rather long rod

I've been through my ups and downs, sides to sides
Yet my heart has yet to decide
My hearts' journey has led to one conclusion thus far
My heart simply desires to be closer to another
To write a poem opening with the family that is closer than any other

A women not just with a longing for the Lamb
but, of intoxicating joy.
She doesn't need to know how to cook or even make a ham
Just someone who can inspire the one that resides deep in my soul, the boy
who had none close to him.
Let her choice to respond in affection not be a whim
But allow our hearts to serve the Lord our God, till our hearts beat their last beat.



"Hippie Peanut"

Who can do anything but be like me!
There is nothing to think or do than to love the tree!
I wander the forest, left and right
trying to find someone to pick a fight!

For if you touch my tree
My violence will be earned for nothing but free!
There is nothing I love more than my trees!
If anyone desires to cut them down they will have to go through me.

There is nothing more beautiful than the tree itself
There is nothing more evil than to take it to make a shelf!
I speak nothing more than simple facts
All should know my name, I am the lorax.



"Feline"

Some things have you wonder why they exist
Even when their evil simply persists
Cats... why do we keep them around?
They don't do much to astound

At most cats seem to do is bite and scratch
I admit some will cuddle to think you are quite the catch.
Most attitudes of such felines is nothing less than malevolent
Although that seems to change when their owner is benevolent.

Though their use is practically null
There is no need to initiate a cull.
If they can make my friend happy
Then, I guess they must not be all that crappy...



"The Hike"

We all prepared for... The Hike...
We were told it would be one we wouldn't like
With miles upon miles of ups and downs
We would have nothing but the comfort of our frowns

We were informed we'd be stuck for hours
Anything we could do would be out of our powers
Our goal to get simply to the top then back down
We are dreading to go after we leave town.

We all prepared to start our long journey
We made light of the situation with jokes that were corny
In our torture we joked and played games, debating who had won
Before we knew it the hike was already done!



"CrAZy?"

I entered a community that seemed delightful
However, I soon learned to be quite frightful.
I mentioned a single word
I considered no one had even heard.

I said the view was quite crazy.
That's when my memory gets a bit hazy.
All of the community spoke at once
Yelling something about rats and rooms as if performing a stunt.

It lasted forever yet im informed it was mere seconds
I learned that is what simply what happens
When you mention that thorn among daisies
In the end I realized im stuck with a bunch of crazies...



"Brown Eyed Girl"

There once was a girl who had eyes
She had entranced many guys.
There was something about her
That always got your emotions in a stir.

It was her eyes, brown and beautiful
Her eyes were much more than crucial.
A window into her soul
As if milky warm chocolate, still in the bowl

Her eyes will surely be burned into my mind
Whenever I see her I feel im stuck in a bind.
My emotions make me want to hurl
All due to this brown eyed girl.



"Snow Wolf Lodge"

I arrive after my long and arduos trip
This new setting, is rather different from what im used to
It all seems like a flip!
There just seems like there is so much to do!

The sights are astounding
The field keeps me abounding!
In the lodge itself I find myself so cozy
My immediate reaction is to be nosey!

Snow wolf lodge has become a home, away from home.
It is nice especially when I decide to roam!
There is always something new to see
There is nowhere I would rather be!



"Red Haired Gal"

There was a girl with hair
She would cause your heart to tear.
Wherever she went, her hair surely followed.
Should often leave men feeling hollow.

She would surely be a catch
However, she could not be snatched. 
A women of passion
And a participate of fashion.

Alas she walks away.
Pherhaps to be seen another day.
Left with nothing, not even a pal
There she goes, the red haired gal.
