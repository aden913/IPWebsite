And the closeness they had grown. <br>

Visitors would come and look<br>
And shake their heads in pity,<br>
Admiring the pairs of oaks<br>
That stood beside the brook. <br>

“Such a shame, that lonely tree,”<br>
They whispered to each other. <br>
“Perhaps someday a wind blown seed<br>
Will bring a mate to thee.”<br>
<br>
The seasons passed and sun and rain<br>
Nourished the little tree,<br>
Encouraging the growth of leaf<br>
And twig and bud and vein. <br>
<br>
Through the years it spread and grew,<br>
Though painfully alone,<br>
And spread its boughs o’er those around,<br>
Withstood the winds that blew. <br>
<br>
One day those visitors returned,<br>
And couldn’t help but marvel<br>
At the lonely sapling they had spurned:<br>
A lovely, flaming maple.<br>

            <h2>Upon Returning </h2>
            <p>
                I walk inside and drop my bags,<br>
                Body overcome by jet lag. <br>
                This familiar place feels strange now<br>
                And subtle changes remind me how<br>
                Long I’ve been away. <br>
                <br>
                I hug my family awkwardly. <br>
                They too have changed, it seems to me. <br>
                Simultaneously, though,<br>
                Their mannerisms are so <br>
                Familiar to me. 
                <br>
                Have they changed or is it I<br>
                Who have been altered by this time?<br>
                The differences it wrought in me <br>
                Are not so obvious to see;<br>
                The work of subtlety. <br>
                <br>
                A cross road stands before me now<br>
                And not the kind observed by cows. <br>
                Will I become the girl I was<br>
                Or embrace the changes made because<br>
                I’m better for their touch?<br>

            <h2>Reflections on Thanksgiving</h2>
            <p>
                A day of feasting, friends, and noise<br>
                Spent indulging in savory joys; <br>
                An afternoon nap on the couch while the kids<br>
                Scatter the carpet with all of their toys. <br>
                <br>
                Such is the general picture we see<br>
                Of what Thanksgiving ought to be. <br>
                But I think there is much more meaning <br>
                Than simply partaking in gluttony.  <br>
                <br>
                I’d venture to say that it’s all in the name<br>
                And the giving of thanks is the key to this game;<br>
                But it might be prudent to inquire<br>
                What hold on Christians this holiday claims. <br>
                <br>
                The Mayflower pilgrims began this whole thing<br>
                On a journey which religious freedom did bring.  <br>
                They sailed across the ocean blue <br>
                And barely survived through winter to spring. <br>
                <br>
                After a bountiful harvest that year,<br>
                With some of the natives they gathered near<br>
                To thank their maker for his abundant provision<br>
                With hearts full of gratitude, wonder, and cheer. <br>
                <br>
                Then into the misty past it faded<br>
                Though by Congress some words on it were traded<br>
                Until Abraham Lincoln declared it official <br>
                In the midst of a war full of violence and hatred.  <br>
                <br>
                But regardless of my nationality,<br>
                I think this day has much claim on me<br>
                Because of the outpouring of grace<br>
                Bestowed freely and fully upon me. <br>
                <br>
                The sentiments are tied to Christmas and Easter, <br>
                I’m grateful for the baby asleep in the feeder;<br>
                The Son of God who lived sinless on earth <br>
                To save me from hell when I could do neither.  <br>
                <br>
                His mutilated body displayed,<br>
                The holes in his hands as he spread them and bade<br>
                Me run to his arms despite <br>
                The mistakes and choices I’ve made. <br>
                <br>
                So behind the faces and foods, I see<br>
                The blood-soaked grain of the mercy tree<br>
                Where Jesus Christ suffered torture <br>
                For me.<br>

            <h2>Last Day</h2>
            <p>
                I came to Echo and age ago,<br>
                Or so it seems to me. <br>
                And since that time, my family’s grown<br>
                From eight to thirty-three. <br>
                <br>
                The faces that were once so strange,<br>
                It pains me now to leave;<br>
                So unconscious was this change<br>
                That I can scarce believe <br>
                A few scant weeks—three months!—ago,<br>
                These dear friends I’d hardly known. <br>
                <br>
                The lodges look empty and sad today,<br>
                Almost unwelcoming<br>
                Devoid of friendliness and play<br>
                As if they, too, are mourning. <br>
                <br>
                I linger in the open air<br>
                With others as we say,<br>
                “Goodbye!” “Drive safely!” “Take care!”<br>
                I wish a different day<br>
                Would carry all of us away. <br>
                I dearly want to stay. <br>
                <br>
                But now, at last, my turn has come<br>
                To leave this blessed place. <br>
                Though the atmosphere is somewhat glum,<br>
                I revel in this grace:<br>
                I’ll see these faces once again <br>
                When we come to Summit’s den. <br>
                <br>
                I relish embraces and blessings received, <br>
                Step into the vehicle<br>
                And turn in time to see<br>
                My receding family waving to me. <br>

                Why have you forgotten us, Lord,<br>
                And left us to the Roman’s sword?<br>
                Four hundred weary years have passed,<br>

                You said a man would crush the snake,<br>
                And the devil’s dark dominion break.<br>
                <br>
                Why don’t you answer as we cry<br>
                Our misery into the sky?<br>
                All I see in the heavens far<br>
                Is one unusually vibrant star. <br>

            <h2>Musical Dilemma</h2>
            <p>
                Music is a form of art,<br>
                Capable in whole or part,<br>
                Of expressing such views as<br>
                The piece’s author has. <br>
                <br>
                Music is a powerful thing,<br>
                Driving deep the words we sing,<br>
                Even when unconsciously<br>
                Seared into the memory. <br>
                <br>
                Sometimes music creeps inside,<br>
                And unnoticed in the lyrics hide<br>
                Lies the devil tells us all,<br>
                Buried in the music’s call. <br>
                <br>
                Scripture says to fix my eyes<br>
                Where purity and honor lie,<br>
                To think on truth and excellence,<br>
                The things of God, in essence. <br>
                <br>
                Songs of sex and drunkenness <br>
                Fail this test, though I confess,<br>
                I have found enjoyment in <br>
                Taylor Swift and Morgan Wallen. <br>
                <br>
                How is one supposed to be<br>
                In this world but not its seed?<br>
                How is the work of Christ in me<br>
                On display for them to see?<br>
                <br>
                Ought I to take pleasure in<br>
                Songs that glorify our sin?<br>
                When these words aloud I sing, <br>
                Do I honor the one true King?<br>
                <br>
                When my inner soundtrack with them rings<br>
                Am I thinking on the things<br>
                That are good and lovely?<br>
                Is this hypocrisy?<br>
                <br>
                Can immoral lyrics be redeemed?<br>
                Can a song that seemed<br>
                Beautiful in form yet filthy in speech<br>
                Have a worthy lesson to teach?<br>
                <br>
                And if such a message it had to show,<br>
                Would that fact alone condone <br>
                Allowing its residence<br>
                Into my mind and home?<br>
